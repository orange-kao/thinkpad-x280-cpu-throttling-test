This is the tool and the test result for ThinkPad X280 CPU performance and throttling behaviour.

'benchmark' is a Ruby script doing the stress test and log the performance, CPU frequency, fan speed and thermal sensor readings.

log directory, SVG files and LibreOffice documents are the result and analysis of the test.
